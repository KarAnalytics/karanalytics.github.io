My name is Karthik Srinivasan and I am an Assistant Professor in the Business Analytics area of [School of Business at University of Kansas](https://business.ku.edu/) (SoB KU). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Management Information Systems from the University of Arizona, Tucson. My research interests are in generative AI impact, crowdfunding, cybersecurity, and interpretable machine learning. My work has been published in Information Systems and analytics journals including MIS Quarterly, Decision Support Systems, INFORMS Journal on Data Science, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, and Nature Digital Medicine.

I teach AI for Business and Enterprise Data Management courses for graduate students. If you are interested in discussing about research, feel free to email me at karthiks@ku.edu
